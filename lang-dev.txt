Idea for SISA-16-Lang

*File is a list of functions and variable declarations
*Function is a series of statements to execute in a body.
*


1) You may write to arbitrary addresses by specifying a type and an address in an assignment.
(short)[0xffff00] = expression

PROBLEMS:
* We need a way to automatically resolve variable names
	* How do we parse []?
	* Extremely complex statements are possible
	* Operator precedence
