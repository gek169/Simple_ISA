.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sisa16_asm
builds and optionally executes SISA16 virtual machine images. for the
.B sisa16
virtual portable computer architecture.


.SH OPTIONS
.BR -i
specifies the imput assembly file. The last input file is used, no others are.

sisa16_asm -i myfile.asm -o myfile.bin

.BR -run
No output file is generated. An emulator built into the assembler is used to immediately execute code, making this an effective scripting language.

sisa16_asm -run myfile.asm

.BR -dis
Specifies a file to diassemble.

sisa16_asm -dis clock.bin 0x20000

will disassemble 64k starting from 0x20000.

you can also use --disassemble

.BR -o
specifies the output filename.

.BR -DBG
Enables debug output from the assembler

.BR -C
prints the compiletime environment information.

.BR -E
expands all macros and does not write an output file.

.BR -pl
prints all lines to base assembler file-building instructions (bytes)

.SH LANGUAGE
.TP
Terminology:
.B Address: 
Location where data is stored in main memory

.B Register: 
a very fast form of memory which is not part of main memory

.B Page: 
256 bytes starting at an address whose low byte is zero.

.B Region: 
64 kilobytes starting at an address whose 2 low bytes is zero.

.B Zero 'Home' or 'Stack' Region: 
the topmost region, where the stack pointer is stuck and where normal non-far loads and stores happen.

.B Device: 
the implementation of gch(), pch(), di(), dcl(), and interrupt from d.h which is used for I/O,
accessible with getchar, putchar, and interrupt
in the assembly language.

.B Segment:
The additional region of memory outside the normal SISA16 address space, which is 
allocated at runtime, used for mass storage (the heap). Typically for loading files or extremely large structures,
but can also be used to hold code.

comment lines are lines that begin with // or #.

.TP
.B Macros

Macros are defined with VAR# lines.

VAR#myMacro#myMacroExpansion

everything after the second # is part of the macro.

Several built-in macros are evaluated inside of macro definitions, such as @ and $.

.TP
.B asm_call

you can call a macro that uses _arg1_, _arg2_, etc.

asm_call#myMacro#5#myVariable##;

these can be inline.

.TP
.B asm_pleq, asm_muleq

if you have defined a macro as being a number, you can add and multiply with it.

these can also be inline

.TP
.B Evaluation Sequence Points (|)

you can use the unix pipe character | to stop the evaluation of macros to a certain point. 
Not only this, but full file writing is done as well, meaning that evaluations of @ between sequence points
results in different values.

.TP
.B Headers

ASM_header can be used to include asm files into a program, from the current working directory or SISA_BIN or
your home folder / sisa16/, or /usr/include/sisa16/

.TP
.B Data

ASM_data_include can be used to include raw binary data into the output.


.TP
.B String Literal Lines

string literal lines start with an exclamation mark. Every character after the exclamation mark is part of the string.
the raw characters are written to the output file (ASCII)

.TP
.B Newline Escapes

Most lines can be escaped such that two lines are merged by using \ before the new line.

.TP
.B section

you can move the output counter anywhere in the file using section

//move to to the first non-home region

section 0x10000

.TP
.B fill

fill a region with a constant byte value

fill size,val

.TP
.B bytes

write bytes to the output file.

bytes 1,2,3,0xE7,0xA1;

.TP
.B shorts

write shorts to the output file, with high byte first.

shorts 0xFFEE, 0x0011;

is semantically equivalent to...

restrict the output counter to the current region and emit an assemblytime error if the output
counter leaves the current region (64k)

.TP
.B asm_begin_block_restriction

the same, but for pages (256 bytes)

.TP
.B asm_end_restriction

End the active restriction.

.TP
.B asm_quit

halt assembly

.TP
.B the dollar sign ($)

builtin macro that expands to the current output counter as a high-low byte pair. Is expanded inside of
macro definitions to allow for labels to be constructed.

.TP
.B the at sign (@)

builtin macro that expands to the current output counter. Is expanded inside of macro
definitions for labels.

.TP
.B SPLIT (%%)

builtin macro expand a number into a high-low byte pair.

sc %32%;

expands to

lrx0 %?3.0%;

expands to a platform-specific floating-point conversion of 3.0 to an unsigned integer, as individual bytes.

.TP
.B SPLIT24 (%&%)

builtin macro to convert 32 bit unsigned integers into 24 bit counterparts.

farstrx0 %&0xAE0000%;

is semantically equivalent to:

farstrx0 0xAE, 0x00, 0x00;

.TP
.B Macro definition semantics

.TP
Macros may only be defined by the following:

1) asm_call (re) defines _argXXX_ macros.

2) VAR# lines define a macro to be all of the text after the second pound symbol.

.TP
This is what happens when you define a macro:

1) a VAR# line is recognized.

2) Builtin macros @ and $ are parsed inside of the line, but no others (including whitespace reduction)

3) Assembler Pass Semantics:

If on the first pass of the assembler, the macro is checked to see if it already exists.

if it does, a warning may be emitted about a redefinining macro.

If on the second passs of the assembler and the macro was not redefining on the first pass,

checks to ensure that the macro evaluates to the same value are done. if the macro does not evaluate the same,

a warning is emitted, even if using -run.

4) Line processing does not proceed to instruction translation or file writing.

.TP
.B Macro Evaluation semantics

The assembler follows this order of execution, for every line, roughly:

1) Backslash newline escapes (for non-special line types) are handled, and preceding whitespace is removed.

2) Special line types are recognized (String litera, ASM_header, ASM_data_include, and ASM_compile)
which do not involve any macro definition.

3) Pre-processing asm_muleq, asm_pleq, and asm_call are recognized (Only on non-VAR# lines, before the vertical bar)

4) The line is checked to see if it is a macro line (VAR#)

5) Macros are expanded on the current line, until the first vertical bar. If at any point one of the
pre-processing macros is discovered before the first vertical bar, jump back to 3. VAR# lines only have the $ and @ symbols parsed...
until the first vertical bar. Past the first vertical bar inside the macro definition, no macro
expansion is done whatsoever.

6) Once all macros are expanded on the line until the first vertical bar (|, the unix pipe character)...

7) Macro definition is handled.

8) Instruction expansion (into bytes) is done.

9) File writing and assembler instruction is done, up to the first vertical bar. File writing is only done
on the second pass, but on the first pass, the output counter is still moved.

10) if the line contains vertical bars, the line up to the first vertical bar is removed and the line is re-evaluated,
from 3 onward. Note that you should NOT put VAR# definitions ANYWHERE except on their own line, it is undefined behavior.

.TP
.B Error handling semantics

if at any point a critical error occurs and the assembler detects it, assembly is aborted.

Unusual or noteworthy phenomenon will be made into warnings, unless on -run

Macro desynchronization between passes (Helpful for recognizing bad labels!) will cause a warning even if
the assembler is invoked with -run.

.TP
.B Undefined and Prohibited behavior

1) You may not put a VAR# definition anywhere other than the beginning of a line.

2) You may not evaluate the at sign or dollar sign inside of a macro if it is beyond a vertical bar.

3) You may not define a macro whose name contains reserved symbols such as $, @, %, |, etc.

4) You may not define a macro which would prevent the use of an instruction.

5) You may not construct a macro whose name starts with the name of an instruction. "lbl_mylabel" is prohibited,
for instance, because it starts with "lb". This prevents you from defining "lb0" which would prevent you from loading
zero into register B.

6) You may not include a file larger than SISA16's address space (16MB)

7) You may not violate an active block (page) or region restriction unless it is disabled or changed.

8) You may not enter a sequence of characters which does not finally resolve into valid commands for the assembler.

9) You may not use an incorrect number of arguments for an instruction.

10) You may not put a comma immediately after an instruction's name.

11) You may not exceed the macro recursion limit (You will break it if you try) of 65535 expansions.

12) You may not have more than 20 levels of header includes (This is configurable.)

.TP
.B Command and argument Separation
Individual commands are separated with semicolons, and sequence points on the same line are defined with vertical bars.

Arguments to commands are separated with commas, but the first never needs a comma.

la13;lb1;add;apush;

is semantically equivalent to

la 13;
lb 1;
add;
push;

but the latter is four separate lines and may assemble slightly slower.

.TP
.B Debugging Assembly

you can pass -DBG to the assembler to get extended debug output.

you can pass -E to the assembler to expand all macros.

you can pass -pl to the assembler to print the lines as they're parsed (Sequence points break this somewhat)

if you want more concise debugging, you can use asm_print or asm_vars.

Both asm_print and asm_vars do no checking of their arguments but normal evaluation is done, 
so if you want to have debug values display, it is optimal to make a line:

//a line.

	asm_print myMacro;

the line will be printed asn you will see this:

asm_printmyMacroExpansionNoticeNoWhitespaces;

alongside the original line in the printout.

.TP
.B Debugging programs

No debugger exists for SISA16 as of writing this. However, you can implement interrupts to perform

memory dumps, display registers, etcetera.

you can also print to the terminal with getchar and putchar (with the default d.h terminal driver...)

Inside of clock.asm, string printing and byte printing in hex is implemented. You can use this in place
of printf if you were doing C code.

.TP
.B Platform Semantics

1) SISA16 is big endian. the highest bytes are stored first.

2) the stack pointer grows up.

3) the stack pointer points to the first free byte.

4) The stack pointer is sixteen bit and trapped in the home region, 0x0000 to 0xFFFF.

5) all memory reads and writes wrap around inside of regions. if you try to far indirect load on a

region boundary, it will wrap around inside that region.

6) Program execution begins at 0. It is best practice to immediately set the A register to some region number
and lfarpc into a main routine as a bootloader.

7) All integers are unsigned, but twos complement can be simulated. add subtract multiply all work
with twos complement numbers. To make a number negative, simply take the complement (compl or rxcompl) and add one.

8) when a command refers to the A or B registers, an extra "l" will be included to indicate 16 bit instructions,
otherwise, it is 8 bit. The C register is always 16 bit and no such distinction is made for it.

alpop vs apop, apop works with a single byte on the stack, but alpop loads 2 bytes (big endian).
but there is no clpop, only cpop, which is 16 bit.

9) call and ret work within the same region, if you want to write subroutines across regions, use farcall and farret.

call and ret are more efficient than farcall and farret, though. If you know you're only going to use a function
within a single region, then call is safe.

10) there are no jmpiflt or jmpifgt instructions. use cmp.

//macro to load your value into register A.

ld_value1;

//this will jump to myLabel if value1 is less than 3. cmp returns 0 if a is less than b, 1 if equal, or 2 if greater than.

lb 3;cmp;lb0;cmp;sc%myLabel%;jmpifeq;

11) Generally, as a convention, the 16 bit registers ABC are used for control flow and low level math, but
RX0-3 are used for 32 bit mathematics.

Macro Expansion

if you have one macro,

myMacro

and another macro,

myMacro1

and myMacro1 is defined after myMacro, then all references to myMacro1
before its definition will be expanded as if it was myMacro followed
by the "1" character. (on pass 1!)

This can be particularly confusing for goto labels, since goto labels
are often defined after where they are used (So that they will expand
correctly on the second pass.)

Note that the order is important here. if you define myMacro1 before myMacro,
then the assembler will detect there is a longer macro to expand on the current line,

and will instead use that.

Interesting little language, don't you think?
